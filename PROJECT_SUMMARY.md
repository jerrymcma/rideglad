   - Development instructions
   - Build commands
   - Google Play submission guide
   - Troubleshooting section

2. **BUILD_GUIDE.md** (6,556 characters)
   - Complete build instructions
   - Release signing configuration
   - Step-by-step Google Play submission
   - Troubleshooting guide
   - Security best practices

3. **QUICK_START.md** (4,530 characters)
   - Quick reference for common tasks
   - Command cheat sheet
   - Project structure overview
   - Next steps checklist

4. **VERIFICATION.md** (6,368 characters)
   - Configuration verification checklist
   - Build process verification

   - Production readiness checklist

## How to Build AAB File

### Simple 3-Step Process

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Build the AAB:**
   ```bash
   npm run build:aab
   ```

3. **Find your AAB file:**
   ```
   android/app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab
   ```

That's it! The file is ready for upload to Google Play Console.

## Key Configuration Details

### Application Configuration
```gradle
applicationId: "com.rideglad"
versionCode: 1
versionName: "1.0"
minSdkVersion: 24
targetSdkVersion: 36
```

### Build Commands
- `npm run build:aab` → Creates AAB for Google Play
- `npm run build:apk` → Creates APK for testing
- `npm run android` → Run in development mode
- `npm start` → Start Metro bundler
- `npm test` → Run tests
- `npm run lint` → Run linter

### Build Output Locations
- **AAB:** `android/app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab`
- **APK:** `android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk`

## Production Readiness Checklist

### ✅ Complete (Ready Now)
- [x] React Native project structure
- [x] Android build configuration
- [x] Build scripts (`npm run build:aab`)
- [x] Documentation
- [x] CI/CD automation
- [x] Version management setup

### ⚠️ Required Before Google Play Submission
- [ ] Generate release keystore
- [ ] Configure release signing
- [ ] Customize app icons
- [ ] Develop actual app features
- [ ] Create privacy policy
- [ ] Prepare store listing (description, screenshots)
- [ ] Set up Google Play Developer account ($25 one-time fee)

## Important Notes

### 🔐 Security - Release Signing
The current configuration uses a **debug keystore** for testing. Before submitting to Google Play:

1. Generate a release keystore (see BUILD_GUIDE.md)
2. Store it securely (you cannot recover it if lost)
3. Configure signing in `android/gradle.properties`
4. Update `android/app/build.gradle` to use release signing
5. **Never commit keystore passwords to git**

### 🌐 Network Requirements
Building requires internet access to download:
- npm packages (first time: ~5 minutes)
- Gradle dependencies (first time: ~5 minutes)
- Android build tools

First build: **5-10 minutes**
Subsequent builds: **1-2 minutes**

### 📊 Expected File Sizes
- AAB file: 10-50 MB (typical for React Native app)
- APK file: 15-60 MB (larger than AAB, split by architecture)

## Next Steps

### 1. Immediate (Build Testing)
```bash
npm install
npm run build:aab
```

### 2. Development
- Customize `App.tsx` with your app features
- Update app name and icons
- Add required permissions
- Implement features

### 3. Preparation for Launch
- Follow BUILD_GUIDE.md for release signing
- Create store assets (icon, screenshots, graphics)
- Write store description
- Set up Google Play Console

### 4. Submission
- Build signed AAB
- Upload to Google Play Console
- Complete store listing
- Submit for review

## Testing the Setup

To verify everything is working:

```bash
# 1. Check Node and npm
node --version  # Should be >= 20
npm --version

# 2. Check Java
java -version   # Should be >= 17

# 3. Check Android SDK
echo $ANDROID_HOME  # Should point to Android SDK

# 4. Install dependencies
npm install

# 5. Try building
npm run build:aab

# 6. Check output
ls -lh android/app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab
```
